        current weather conditions and forecasted weather for multiple cities. 
        It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve data for the cities, AJAX to hook into the API 
        to retrieve the data in JSON format, dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by 
        jQuery, and displays a search history which the user can click to access past 
        cities searched via local storage.

        This weather dashboard shows the weather conditions in real time along with a 
        five day forecast when you enter the city in the search bar.
        
        A few different files were used in creating this application such 
        as, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript powered by third-party API's such as 
        Moment.js, Bootstrap, OpenWeather's GeoCoding and Ond Cal API's.`
